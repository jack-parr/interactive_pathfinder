# interactive_pathfinder
These files enable you to draw a maze and place the start and end positions, and then find the shortest path through the maze using either Dijkstras or A* algorithm.
To use, run the python file 'display' and follow the on-screen instructions.

My goal from this mini-project was to learn more about pathfinding algorithms and their implementation.

Note: this project was completed before I studied any code optimisation.
